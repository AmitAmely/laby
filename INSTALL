linux:

  to compile laby, you need ocaml >= 3.10.0 and lablgtk >= 2.14.0
  (with support for gtksourceview2), then execute the following
  commands in the archive main directory:

    make
    ln -s ${PWD}/data ${HOME}/.config/laby

  if you want the program to produce some kind of absurd sounds, make
  sure the alsa "aplay" command is present on your system.

  now to run laby type:

    ./laby


windows:

  the best advice is to use pre-compiled binaries available on the web:
    http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~gimenez/laby
  those binaries are cross-compiled using mingw-ocaml.

  if you plan to compile them by yourself on windows, you will
  probably need patience and a lot of good luck and the following
  software:

    - ocaml >= 3.10.0 :
        http://caml.inria.fr/download.en.html
    - lablgtk >= 2.14.0 :

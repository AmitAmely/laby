linux:

  you need ocaml >= 3.10.0 and lablgtk >= 2.10.0, then execute the
  following commands in this directory:

    make
    ln -s ${PWD}/data ${HOME}/.config/laby

  if you want the program to produce some kind of absurd sounds, make
  sure the alsa "aplay" command is present on your system.

  now to run laby type:

    ./laby


windows (not supported yet, won't work without big amounts of hacking):

  laby installation requires:

    - ocaml >= 3.10.0 :
        http://caml.inria.fr/download.en.html
    - lablgtk >= 2.10.0 :
